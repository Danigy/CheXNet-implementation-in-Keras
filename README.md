# CheXNet-implementation-in-Keras
This is a reimplementation of CheXNet  using Python3 and Keras. CheXNet, is a 121-layer convolutional neural network that inputs a chest X-ray image and outputs the probability of pneumonia along with a heatmap localizing the areas of the image most indicative of pneumonia.
